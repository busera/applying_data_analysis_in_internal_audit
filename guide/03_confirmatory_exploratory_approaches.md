| Starting Point     | Specific hypotheses or expectations          | Open-ended questions or areas of interest              |
| Objective          | Verify, confirm, or refute/disprove          | Discover, understand, or generate hypotheses           |
| Analytical Methods | Statistical tests, compliance checking       | Data mining, pattern recognition, advanced analytics   |
| Outcomes           | Clear yes/no answers or quantifiable results | Insights, patterns, or areas for further investigation |
[Aspects of confirmatory and exploratory approaches in internal audit]

### Confirmatory Approach in Internal Audit

Characteristics:
- Based on specific audit objectives, known risks, or control expectations
- Often tied to compliance with policies, regulations, or industry standards
- Typically results in clear, definitive conclusions
- Uses structured analytical techniques and statistical methods

Purpose in Audit:
- Verify compliance with policies, laws, and regulations
- Test the effectiveness of internal controls
- Validate the accuracy of financial or operational data
- Confirm that processes are operating as intended

Example Questions:
- Is the error rate in expense reports less than the 5% threshold set by company policy?
- Are 100% of transactions over $10,000 approved by an authorised manager?
- Has the new inventory system reduced stockout incidents by at least 30% as projected?

### Exploratory Approach in Internal Audit

Characteristics:
- Open-ended and not driven by predefined hypotheses
- Aims to uncover unknown patterns, trends, or relationships
- May lead to new lines of inquiry or future audit objectives
- Often uses more advanced or flexible analytical techniques

Purpose in Audit:
- Identify potential risk areas or control weaknesses not previously considered
- Uncover inefficiencies or opportunities for process improvement
- Generate insights to inform risk assessment and audit planning
- Discover unexpected relationships or anomalies for further investigation

Example Questions:
- What factors influence the approval patterns for high-value transactions?
- How do error rates in financial reporting vary across different departments or processes?
- Are there any unusual patterns in inventory movement that might indicate fraud or inefficiency?
