## About This Project

This project explores the application of data analysis techniques in internal auditing, adapting key concepts from academic research methodologies to the practical world of internal audit. It focuses on two distinct concepts:

- Confirmatory vs. Exploratory Questions
- Causal vs. Non-Causal Questions

The repository includes real-life examples, Python code for analysis and visualization, and comprehensive guides to help internal auditors leverage data analysis effectively.
