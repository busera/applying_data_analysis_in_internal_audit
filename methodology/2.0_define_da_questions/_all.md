## Introduction & Problem Statement

The application of data analysis in internal audit has been a topic of increasing interest and discussion in my recent months. While numerous knowledge briefs and guides are available from respected organizations like the IIA[^1] and ISACA[^2][^3][^4], these resources often present a more high-level and generic approach. As a professional with a background in data science, I've found that many existing resources in this area lack some depth and specificity to better bridge the gap between data analysis theory and its practical application in internal audit.

This observation has motivated me to create this comprehensive guide. This guide explores the application of data analysis techniques in internal auditing, adapting key concepts from academic research methodologies[^5] to the practical world of internal audit focusing on two distinct concepts:

- Confirmatory vs. Exploratory Questions
- Causal vs. Non-Causal Questions

To further bridge the gap between theory and practice, I am planning to build a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/busera/applying_data_analysis_in_internal_audit) that will collect examples (generated and anonymized real-life data), including Python code for analysis and visualization.

## Definitions
The following definitions are taken from "Classification of different questions" (Section 1.1.2), Card et al. (2021).

 **Confirmatory Questions**
- Typically involve a set of hypotheses, including a null hypothesis with one or more alternatives. 
- These questions often require a concrete research design to test these hypotheses and are usually answered via inductive inference. 
- Confirmatory analyses are considered to make a "scientific step forward" and yield "strong inference‚Äù. 

**Exploratory Questions**
- These questions are not explicitly hypothesis-driven. Instead, they are often considered to be hypothesis-generating. 
- Exploratory analyses do not aim to achieve "strong inference" and may yield a higher false positive rate. 
- However, they are valuable for new discoveries and unexplored topics.

**Causal questions**
- Causal questions aim to draw conclusions about a causal relationship between the indexed exposures and outcomes. 
- They typically include:
	- A well-defined cause
	- A well-defined outcome
	- A scientifically plausible effect on the outcome that can be attributable to the cause

**Non-Causal questions**
- Non-causal questions are typically descriptive or observational/associational. 
- They describe the objective existence of certain phenomena or examine relationships between factors without considering underlying causal mechanisms.


## Confirmatory vs. Exploratory Approaches in Internal Audit

In internal audit, both confirmatory and exploratory approaches play crucial roles in providing assurance and adding value to the organization.

| Aspect             | Confirmatory Approach                        | Exploratory Approach                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Starting Point     | Specific hypotheses or expectations          | Open-ended questions or areas of interest              |
| Objective          | Verify, confirm, or refute/disprove          | Discover, understand, or generate hypotheses           |
| Analytical Methods | Statistical tests, compliance checking       | Data mining, pattern recognition, advanced analytics   |
| Outcomes           | Clear yes/no answers or quantifiable results | Insights, patterns, or areas for further investigation |

### Confirmatory Approach in Internal Audit

Characteristics:
- Based on specific audit objectives, known risks, or control expectations
- Often tied to compliance with policies, regulations, or industry standards
- Typically results in clear, definitive conclusions
- Uses structured analytical techniques and statistical methods

Purpose in Audit:
- Verify compliance with policies, laws, and regulations
- Test the effectiveness of internal controls
- Validate the accuracy of financial or operational data
- Confirm that processes are operating as intended

Example Questions:
- Is the error rate in expense reports less than the 5% threshold set by company policy?
- Are 100% of transactions over $10,000 approved by an authorised manager?
- Has the new inventory system reduced stockout incidents by at least 30% as projected?

### Exploratory Approach in Internal Audit

Characteristics:
- Open-ended and not driven by predefined hypotheses
- Aims to uncover unknown patterns, trends, or relationships
- May lead to new lines of inquiry or future audit objectives
- Often uses more advanced or flexible analytical techniques

Purpose in Audit:
- Identify potential risk areas or control weaknesses not previously considered
- Uncover inefficiencies or opportunities for process improvement
- Generate insights to inform risk assessment and audit planning
- Discover unexpected relationships or anomalies for further investigation

Example Questions:
- What factors influence the approval patterns for high-value transactions?
- How do error rates in financial reporting vary across different departments or processes?
- Are there any unusual patterns in inventory movement that might indicate fraud or inefficiency?

## Causal vs. Non-Causal Data Analysis in Internal Audit

### Causal Data Analysis

Aims to establish cause-effect relationships between variables.

Techniques:
- Difference-in-differences analysis
- Propensity score matching
- Instrumental variable analysis
- Regression discontinuity design

Example applications:
- Assessing the impact of a new training program on employee productivity
- Evaluating how changes in credit policies affect bad debt rates
- Determining the effect of implementing new controls on error rates

### Non-Causal Data Analysis

Describes relationships or current states without implying causation.

Techniques:
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Time series analysis
- Network analysis

Example applications:
- Mapping the flow of transactions through different systems
- Analyzing the distribution of processing times for customer requests
- Identifying correlations between different risk indicators


## Application in Internal Audit Practice

To illustrate how confirmatory, exploratory, causal, and non-causal approaches can be applied in internal audit, let's examine some common audit areas.

## The Role of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis serves as a critical first step in the data analysis process for internal audits, bridging both confirmatory and exploratory approaches.

Key EDA Techniques:
- Data quality assessment (missing values, outliers, inconsistencies)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, box plots)
- Correlation analysis

EDA in the Audit Process:
1. Initial Data Exploration: Use EDA to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and potential areas of interest.
2. Hypothesis Refinement: Based on EDA findings, refine existing hypotheses or generate new ones for confirmatory analysis.
3. Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual patterns or outliers that may warrant further investigation.
4. Variable Selection: Determine which variables are most relevant for subsequent analyses.

## The Value of Exploratory and Non-Causal Approaches


In my experience, exploratory and non-causal questions often provide the most valuable insights in internal auditing, particularly in larger organizations. This is due to several factors:

- Confirmatory questions are typically already addressed and implemented by first and second lines of defense, reducing the need for internal audit to focus heavily on these areas.
- Causal questions, while valuable, often face practical limitations:
	- Required data may not be available in sufficient quantity or quality
	- Results can be challenging to report and communicate, especially when dealing with complex statistical concepts
- Exploratory and non-causal approaches offer several advantages:
	- They can uncover unexpected patterns or risks that might be missed by more targeted approaches
	- They often require less stringent data requirements, making them more practical in many audit contexts
	- The insights gained can be more easily communicated and actioned by stakeholders


## Conclusion

This guide has explored four key approaches to data analysis in internal auditing, each serving a distinct purpose:
- **Confirmatory questions** verify specific hypotheses or compliance with established policies, using techniques like compliance testing, hypothesis testing, and trend analysis to provide assurance on known risks and controls.
- **Exploratory questions** uncover patterns or relationships in the data without preconceived notions, employing methods such as clustering, correlation analysis, and anomaly detection to identify emerging risks or unknown control weaknesses.
- **Causal questions** investigate cause-and-effect relationships between variables, utilizing techniques like difference-in-differences analysis and regression analysis to understand the impact of specific factors or interventions.
- **Non-causal questions** examine relationships or distributions in the data without implying causation, using descriptive statistics and time series analysis to describe complex relationships and patterns within data.

By integrating confirmatory, exploratory, causal, and non-causal approaches in internal audit data analysis, auditors can:
- Provide assurance on known risks and controls (confirmatory)
- Identify emerging risks or unknown control weaknesses (exploratory)
- Understand the impact of specific factors or interventions (causal)
- Describe complex relationships and patterns within data (non-causal)
- Offer deeper insights into business processes and potential improvements
- Support a more risk-based and value-added approach to internal auditing

This multifaceted strategy empowers auditors to move beyond traditional compliance-focused auditing. It enables a more comprehensive understanding of the audited environment, facilitating proactive risk management and strategic decision-making support.
