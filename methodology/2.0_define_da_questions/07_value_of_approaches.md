## The Value of Exploratory and Non-Causal Approaches

In my experience, exploratory and non-causal questions often provide the most valuable insights in internal auditing, particularly in larger organizations. This is due to several factors:

- Confirmatory questions are typically already addressed and implemented by first and second lines of defense, reducing the need for internal audit to focus heavily on these areas.
- Causal questions, while valuable, often face practical limitations:
	- Required data may not be available in sufficient quantity or quality
	- Results can be challenging to report and communicate, especially when dealing with complex statistical concepts
- Exploratory and non-causal approaches offer several advantages:
	- They can uncover unexpected patterns or risks that might be missed by more targeted approaches
	- They often require less stringent data requirements, making them more practical in many audit contexts
	- The insights gained can be more easily communicated and actioned by stakeholders
