## The Role of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis serves as a critical first step in the data analysis process for internal audits, bridging both confirmatory and exploratory approaches.

Key EDA Techniques:
- Data quality assessment (missing values, outliers, inconsistencies)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, box plots)
- Correlation analysis

EDA in the Audit Process:
1. Initial Data Exploration: Use EDA to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and potential areas of interest.
2. Hypothesis Refinement: Based on EDA findings, refine existing hypotheses or generate new ones for confirmatory analysis.
3. Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual patterns or outliers that may warrant further investigation.
4. Variable Selection: Determine which variables are most relevant for subsequent analyses.
