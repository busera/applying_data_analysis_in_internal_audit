## Phase 3 - Analyze

### Objective
Perform data analysis in alignment with the defined objectives and questions.

### Key Activities

- **8.0 Conduct Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
	- 8.1 Calculate descriptive statistics
	- 8.2 Create initial visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots)
	- 8.3 Conduct correlation analysis
	- 8.4 Identify potential patterns, anomalies, or areas of interest
	- 8.5 Document initial observations and hypotheses generated from EDA
		- Refine initial questions and hypotheses **[[2.1 Formulate initial questions and hypotheses]]**
	- 8.6 Address newly identified gaps or additional data cleansing activities: **[[6.0 Data Validation and Cleansing]]**
<br><br>
- **9.0 Develop and Execute Test Scripts and Queries**
	- 9.1 Write scripts or queries to implement the planned analyses (both EDA and targeted)
	- 9.2 Test and debug scripts/queries on sample data
	- 9.3 Run the developed scripts/queries on the full dataset
<br><br>
- **10.0 Perform Targeted/Focused Analysis**
	- 10.1 Apply specific analytical techniques based on question types and initial EDA findings
	- 10.2 Perform statistical tests or implement models as appropriate
	- 10.3 Conduct deeper investigations into areas of interest identified in initial exploration
	- 10.4 Iterate on analyses as needed, refining approaches based on interim results
<br><br>
- **11.0 Interpret & Analyze Results**
	- 11.1 Review outputs for reasonableness and consistency
	- 11.2 Interpret results in the context of audit objectives, questions and hypotheses
	- 11.3 Validate findings through cross-verification and subject matter expert consultation and auditee
	- 11.4 Identify areas requiring further investigation or additional data
	- 11.5 Synthesize insights from both EDA and targeted analyses
<br><br>
- **12.0 Documentation and Iteration**
	- 12.1 Document insights, methodologies, and decision points throughout the analysis process
	- 12.2 Maintain a log of all analyses performed, including unsuccessful attempts and rationale
	- 12.4 Prepare preliminary findings for review with key stakeholders and auditees

### Key Deliverables
- Documented scripts, for example Python code or Jupyter Notebooks, and logs (for both EDA and targeted analyses)
- Detailed analysis of data sets and outputs
- Information visualization (charts, graphs, tables) illustrating key findings
- Preliminary findings report, including:
	- Summary of EDA results
	- Outcomes of targeted analyses
	- Identified patterns, anomalies, and areas of interest
- Analysis methodology documentation, including decision points and rationale
