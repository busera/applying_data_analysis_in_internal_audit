## Definitions
The following definitions are taken from "Classification of different questions" (Section 1.1.2), Card et al. (2021).

 **Confirmatory Questions**
- Typically involve a set of hypotheses, including a null hypothesis with one or more alternatives. 
- These questions often require a concrete research design to test these hypotheses and are usually answered via inductive inference. 
- Confirmatory analyses are considered to make a "scientific step forward" and yield "strong inference‚Äù. 

**Exploratory Questions**
- These questions are not explicitly hypothesis-driven. Instead, they are often considered to be hypothesis-generating. 
- Exploratory analyses do not aim to achieve "strong inference" and may yield a higher false positive rate. 
- However, they are valuable for new discoveries and unexplored topics.

**Causal questions**
- Causal questions aim to draw conclusions about a causal relationship between the indexed exposures and outcomes. 
- They typically include:
	- A well-defined cause
	- A well-defined outcome
	- A scientifically plausible effect on the outcome that can be attributable to the cause

**Non-Causal questions**
- Non-causal questions are typically descriptive or observational/associational. 
- They describe the objective existence of certain phenomena or examine relationships between factors without considering underlying causal mechanisms.
